## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To embark on this pixelated adventure, you'll need a few tools:

- **C++ Compiler** (supporting C++11 or later)
- **SFML Library** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- **SQLite3 Library** (for games requiring data persistence)
- **CMake** (optional, but highly recommended for building)

### Installing SFML

Getting SFML ready is straightforward. Choose your operating system:

#### Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```

#### macOS (with Homebrew):
```bash
brew install sfml
```

#### Windows:
- Download SFML from the [official website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)
- Follow the installation guide for your compiler

## 🚀 How to Build and Run

Ready to jump into the action? Each game is self-contained and can be compiled independently.

### Using g++ directly:
For a quick start, navigate to a game's directory and compile with g++:
```bash
cd "01 Tetris"
g++ -o tetris main.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
./tetris
```

### Using CMake (Recommended for all games):
For a more robust build process, especially if you plan to build all games, CMake is your friend:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## 🎯 Game Controls

Mastering the controls is key to victory! While specific controls vary per game, here are the common patterns you'll encounter:

- **Arrow Keys** - Movement/Navigation
- **Space** - Action/Shoot
- **Mouse** - Selection/Interaction
- **ESC** - Pause/Menu

For detailed controls, keep an eye on the game window itself or peek into the source code comments!

## 📁 Project Structure

This project is organized into several modules, with each game residing in its own dedicated directory. Below is a high-level overview of the project's package structure:

```
.
├── 01 Tetris/
│   ├── main.cpp
│   └── images/
├── 02 Doodle Jump/
│   ├── main.cpp
│   └── images/
├── ...
├── build/
├── cmake-build-debug/
├── docs/
├── scripts/
├── Writerside/
└── README.md
```

Each game directory (e.g., `01 Tetris/`, `02 Doodle Jump/`) typically contains:
- `main.cpp` - The main source code file for the game.
- `images/` - A directory holding game assets like sprites and textures.
- `fonts/` (optional) - A directory for custom fonts used in the game.
- Other specific files (e.g., `shader.frag` for Tron, `Connector.hpp` for Chess) as needed by the game.

The top-level directories include:
- `build/` and `cmake-build-debug/`: Directories for build artifacts generated by CMake.
- `docs/`: Contains project documentation.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for various tasks.
- `Writerside/`: Related to documentation generation using JetBrains Writerside.
- `README.md`: This very file, providing an overview of the project.

## 🔧 Development Notes

A peek behind the pixelated curtain:

- All games are crafted using **SFML** for seamless graphics, audio, and input handling.
- Some games utilize **SQLite3** for data persistence, such as high scores.
- Each game follows a consistent structure, featuring robust game loops, efficient event handling, and smooth rendering.
- Most games boast charming sprite-based graphics, powered by their respective image assets.
- Keep an eye out! Some games might require additional files like custom fonts or unique sound effects to complete the experience.
